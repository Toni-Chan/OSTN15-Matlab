# OSTN15-Matlab
An implementation of Ordnance Survey conversion from OSGB36 to WGS84. For MATLAB use, but can be changed into general use

This tool converts coordinates between ETRS89 (WGS84, GPS) lat/lon/elevation and OSGB36 easting/northing/elevation.

Conversions make use of Ordnance Survey's OSTN15 and OSGM15 transformations, and should thus be accurate to within 1m.
Usage:   
 - [eas,nor,hei] = OSTN15_Matlab('gps-to-grid',lat,lon)\ converts matrices of ETRS89 to OSGB36 and checks LIDAR DSM heights data in ./LIDAR . If no data available hei will be -9999.
 - [lat,lon] = OSTN15_Matlab('grid-to-gps',eas,nor)\ converts matrices of OSGB36 to ETRS89.
 - OSTN15_Matlab('gps-to-grid',filename)\ converts a batch of data in filename from ETRS89 to OSGB36 and checks LIDAR DSM heights data in ./LIDAR . If no data available hei will be -9999, outputing to filename-output.csv and filename-raw.csv .
 - OSTN15_Matlab('grid-to-gps',filename)\ converts a batch of data in filename OSGB36 to ETRS89, outputing to filename-output.csv.
 - OSTN15_Matlab('test')\ checks embedded data integrity and runs conversion tests with known coordinates.
 - OSTN15_Matlab\ displays this message, and runs a test.
			
In the batch conversion case:
- Input rows must have 2 columns -- lat or easting, lon or northing, with comma separator
- Output rows have 3 columns -- easting or lat, northing or lon, elevation(if from gps to grid), separated with commas. If no elevation data available, elevation returns -9999. At eas-nor mode, a heading line tells which block the point is in. This helps to decide which LIDAR data file to download
- In case of out-of-range input coordinates, all output columns will be zero
- Malformatted input leads unexpected output
